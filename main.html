The plot of the novel is loosely similar to events in Odysseus’s journey home after the Trojan War. The novel has three central characters, Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus, and Molly who are intended to be modern counterparts of Ulysses, Telemachus, and Penelope respectively. All the events and activities that make up the plot takes place on a single day and in and immediately around Dublin.
